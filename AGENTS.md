<!-- MANUAL ADDITIONS START -->
- Test-driven development (TDD) for all features (from unit to e2e, full spectrum. try to avoid mocks). 1. Understand, what type of test is required for a step. 2. Write a minimal failing test. 3. Write a minimal implementation that makes the test pass. 4. Refactor the implementation to make it better. 5. Repeat.
- Think before implementing anything, if it's not already implemented.
- Think carefully about the code structure and organization before implementing anything.
